## Behavioral

Most of the behavioral questions should be answered in the CAR format. At least three sentences for each question (one for cause, one for action and one for result).

- [ ] What is progressive rendering?
  - **Explanation:**
 Progressive Rendering is when you render chunks of a webpage in the sever, starting with *critical* content, and stream that to the client in parts so they don't have to wait for a whole page to load.
  - **Use:**
  The use of progressive rendering is to render *critical* content on server while streaming to client, so there is no wait and the page loads faster than client-side-rendering(CSR) and server-side-rendering(SSR). It's also benifitial to users on slower networks. Down-side is it won't be interactive until the page fully loads.

  Used to load *critical* CSS in the head
  - **Example:**
  An exampe of progressive rendering would be Amazon, rendering *critical* content on the server and stream it to the client without waiting after this the non-critical content is streamed to the client

### CSS

- [ ] What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?
  - **Explanation:**
  CSS selector's specificity uses an algorithm that calculates the weight of a given selector to determine which property value to apply to the element.
  - **Use:**
  Used to determine what propety value is most relevant to apply to a element.
  - **Example:**
  p {..} vs p.class{..} the second seclector weight would be calculated higher because its specificity is higher so the declarations in this would override any of the first selectors declarations
  - **Source:**
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity

- [ ] What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? 
Which would you choose, and why?
  - **Explanation:**
  Resetting CSS is a set of styles that load before your other styles to remove built-in browser styles. 
  Normalizing CSS provides cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements.

  I would use Normalizing CSS because debugging is easier and it's modular (styling is divided into sections for ease)
  - **Use:**
  The use of Resetting and Normalizing CSS is to make the default in browser to look more consistent across browsers
  - **Example:**
  CSS Reset can force evey browser to have all its styles reset to null
  CSS Normalize will preserve useful default styles rather than stripping all styles

- [ ] Describe floats and how they work.
  - **Explanation:**
  Float is a CSS property that removes an element from the normal flow and places an element on the left or right side of its container.
  - **Use:**
  This could be used to allow text and inline elements to wrap around the floated element
  - **Example:**
  float: left; on an image would remove an element from flow and place it in the top left of its container allowing text to wrap around the element.
  - **Source:**
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float


- [ ] Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.
  - **Explanation:**
  z-index is a CSS property that sets the order of positioned elements that overlap
  overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller one
  - **Use:**
  To overlap elements with a position value (except static) so that it appears closer to you
  - **Example:**
  1{position: absolute; z-index:1;}  2{position:absolute; z-index: 2;}
  2 would overlap 1
  - **Source:**
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index


- [ ] Describe BFC (Block Formatting Context) and how it works.
  - **Explanation:**
    BFC is a layout concept in CSS to determine the position and size of an element on a webpage
  - **Use:**
  BFC addresses an issue of overlapping/unexpected layout behavior of elements due to HTML default styling
  - **Example:**
  BFC would help contain internal floats and prevent elements from covering each other
  - **Source:**
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explain-the-working-of-the-block-formatting-context/#


- [ ] What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?
  - **Explanation:**
  clear is a CSS property that sets whether an element must be moved below(cleared) of floating elements that come before it.
  - **Use:**
  clear determines which floated element can float beside it and which side it can float. Or if the cleared element uses both then it will be placed below the floats
  - **Example:**
  clear: left; will stop floats from wrapping with the cleared element on its left side.
  - **Source:**
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clear?retiredLocale=uk

  
- [ ] Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.
  - **Explanation:**
  It's a technique of taking a handful of images and arranging them into one single image
  - **Use:**
  The goal of using an image sprite is to cut down the number of HTTP requests made
  - **Example:**
  Using an image sprite as a background on a span element and then changing the position of the image sprite using background-position property to show different images.

- [ ] How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?
  - **Explanation:**
  I would approach fixing browser-specific styling issues by using Normalize
  - **Use:**
  Because this makes sure default styles are consistent across different browsers, which can fix many common compatibility issues
  - **Example:**
  - **Source:**

- [ ] How do you serve your pages for feature-constrained browsers? What techniques/processes do you use?
  - **Explanation:**
  I serve my pages for feature-constrained browsers by the process of building an application for modern browsers while maintaining its functionality in older browsers.
  - **Use:**
  To do this I use feature queries that test if a browser supports a certain feature
  - **Example:**
  /* `@supports` at-rule */
  @supports (color: red) {
   CSS rules to apply
  }

  /* `supports()` function */
    @import `/css/styles.css` supports(color: red);

- [ ] What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it available only for screen readers)?
  - **Explanation:**
  Using semantically meaningful tags you can create a class like .sr-only to visually hide content meant only for screen readers by positioning the elements off the browser window
  - **Use:**
  Enable better accessibility for users who rely on screen readers
  - **Example:**
  .sr-only {
  position: absolute;
  left: -10000px;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  top: auto;
  overflow: hidden;
  }

- [ ] Have you ever used a grid system, and if so, what do you prefer?
  - **Explanation:**
  CSS grid layout is great for dividing a page into major parts or defining relationships in size, position, and layer. I would prefer grids over Flexbox when dealing with larger-scale content
  - **Use:**
  allows elements to be aligned into columns and rows
  - **Example:**
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 10px;
  grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);
}
.one {
  grid-column: 1 / 3;
  grid-row: 1;
}
.two {
  grid-column: 2 / 4;
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
}
.three {
  grid-column: 1;
  grid-row: 2 / 5;
}
.four {
  grid-column: 3;
  grid-row: 3;
}
.five {
  grid-column: 2;
  grid-row: 4;
}
.six {
  grid-column: 3;
  grid-row: 4;

- [ ] What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?
  - **Explanation:**
  The feature of being able to reference a specific instance of a local binding iin an enclosing scope and a function that references bindings from local scopes around it is called closure
  - **Use:**
  This behavior limits concerns of bindings, but also makes it possible to use function values in some creative ways
  - **Example:**
  function multiplier(factor) {
  return number => number * factor;
}

  let twice = multiplier(2);
  console.log(twice(5));
  // â 10

  Thinking about programs like this takes some practice. A good mental  model is to think of function values as containing both the code in  their body and the environment in which they are created. When called,   the function body sees the environment in which it was created, not the   environment in which it is called.

  In the example, multiplier is called and creates an environment in which  its factor parameter is bound to 2. The function value it returns, which   is stored in twice, remembers this environment. So when that is called,   it multiplies its argument by 2.

- [ ] What is the difference between `==` and `===`?
  - **Explanation:**
  `==` performs type coercion before making any comparison, which automatically converts the datatype of one operand to be the same, so comparrison is possible. `===` works like `==` but does not use type coercion, it first checks if datatype matches, then checks value.
  - **Use:**
  `==` for 'loose equality'
  `===` for 'strict equality'
  - **Example:**
  `==`
  const a = 100;
  const b = '100';

  console.log(a == b) // true
  `===`
  const a = 100;
  const b = '100';

  console.log(a === b); // false

### CS TheoryÂ 

- [B ] What is recursion and give an example using javascript?
  - **Explanation:**
  Recursion is when a function calls itself
  - **Use:**
  Recursion can be used instead of a looping variant which describes the concept more clearly. There is a downside however, in JS it's about 3 times slower than the looping version which is generally cheaper than calling a function multiple times.
  - **Example:**
  function power(base, exponent) {
    if (exponent == 0) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      return base * power(base, exponent - 1);
    }
  }

  console.log(power(2, 3));
  // â 8

Here is a helpful list of other reverse interview questions: [https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview](https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview)

## Whiteboard

When talking through a whiteboard problem or a coding challenge with an interviewer you should use the PREP method. (Don't write PREP in the actual interview, but use it now while doing codewars/leetcode). Going through this will help you engage with the interviewer (and possibly burn up some time ð)

- **Parameters**
  - Inputs
  - Ask questions
    - Will it always be a number?
    - Will it ever be negative?
    - Any gotchas?
- **Returns**
  - Ask questions
    - Do you want it returned or is a console.log better?
    - Should I pass a whole array of solutions back or just a single solution?
- **Examples**
  - Show a couple black box examples, aka test cases
    - I pass in these arguments and get these results, is that correct?
  - Examples are a good idea because "you have the receipts" if the interviewer decides to change things.
- **Pseudocode**
  - Write pseudocode of each of the steps
